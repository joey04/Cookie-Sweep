## Cookie-Sweep
Firefox extension that sweeps all cookies at browser startup. You can add domains to the whitelist on the options page, which will preserve all cookies from these domains during the sweep. All other cookies get removed.

There is also a button on the options page to do a sweep at any time.

This is a fork of [the original](https://github.com/mpopp75/cookie-sweep) written by mpopp75. Full credit to him for the cookie sweep functionality and the nice options interface.

The important change I made was adding the ability to sweep at browser startup, as requested [here](https://github.com/mpopp75/cookie-sweep/issues/7).

Note that there is no option to disable the startup sweep.
